# Life Expectancy vs. GDP of Countries
## Exploratory Analysis
_Check out the project file in the main branch!_

This exploratory analysis project took a look at country's GDPs and compared them to the life expectancies at birth by country.
This project was good practice for me to use seaborn and matplotlib for visualizing and comparing categories of data from the dataset.
